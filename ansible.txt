ansible is a configartion tool whic is use configar and update the system it is automation tool
ansible must install on linux system windows is not support ansible so we need linux with pyhon 2.4 and more  
it is working like server clint or master or sleve  arcithec 
you can mange netwok divce also like firewall and all 
when your going to install the ansible u should have comuniction betwin all the system 
ansible need SSH to comuniction with ssh you can't perform the any task 
install the ansible it have some depenadncy also u have install that

when you install ansible it have invantry file you can find the invantry file in locatoin in config file 
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
the invantry file is in my case in 
/etc/ansible/host = u can enter ip of clint system in this hosts file 

to check the all coneected node use cmd 

ansible all --list -host 
you can enter the all host in one single group  like [web_server] or [myclint] and enter ip of clint below 

you can enter hostname also instenc with ip also 

to check the aprticul group of host you can  use below cmd 

ansible web --list-hosts

if you want to check both server use belwo cmd 

ansible web : app --list-hots or ansible all --list-hosts

[main:children]
app 
web

in abow group we add other group also using children

you can use your won invantryfile also 

ansible all --list-hosts -i /home/amardip/myinvfile
                                |
                                |____________________________this is the path of invantryfile

if you want to use custom file with give i and file path of invfile you have to make change in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

give your invantryfile file path in front of invantry = /home/amardip/myinvfile

so you dont have to mantion a path of file every time 

you have more than one user and that user want to change ther invenrty file data so it make confilt 

to resolve this isssue we use ansible.cfg to set invantryfile path  we nver user old ansible.cfg file 

copy the curent location of file in your location and use this 

copy /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg /home/amardip/ansible.cfg

we can copy that file and keep in user locatoin and you can set a new ansible.cfg path useing export cmd 

export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/home/amardip/ansible.cfg

after this you can check the usering ansible --version 

than change the invantryfile path 

in abouw case after restartthe export entry remove to make this permnet inside userhome accout ther is file .bashrc
make entry in this file
.bashrc 
expor ANSIBLE_CONFIG =/home/amardip/ansible.cfg

and if user want to remove the varbeal which we set for ansible use belwo cmd 

unset ANSIBLE_CONFIG 

if you have set all ther option and some as u which enty it choose for this the anser is 

1 use -i filepath
2 varbeal(export)
3 defult location


if u run any cmd from the ansible_server it will run that cmd on worker node useing same user which you loging in ansible_server
so it will ask you key authontication do overcome from this problme we can set host_key_checking = false in ansible.cfg

@@@@@@@@@@@
            ansible all -m command -a " ls " -k 
                     |    | 
                     |____|______________________________target grop u can use other group also like app , web 
                          |___________module for m we use command module with argument for this we use -a
                          |_____________  ls is simple cmd and -k to eun this without cmd 


 you can use bash for connect the ec2 copy past your cmd from aws portal 

 https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html 
 installation_guide

if you want to install letesta vr of ansible you can copy repo form epl side and creat repo 
than install ansible 

u can make passwrdathunticationallwo yes in sshd_config in ssh

after this you can shear a key with clint also 

ssh -keygen
ssh -copy-id user@hostip 

############################################################################## 
you can find the ansible playbook in same folder with extenion of yml

tu run the playbook you have to give cmd like below 

ansible-playbook myfilelocatio_or_name.yml

if you want to install any pakg and you need root accees use k in end of cmd 

ansible-playbook myfilelocatio_or_name.yml -k

if we user -vvv it will give you all the infomation about how ths ansble working 

ansible all -vvv -m command -a " ls " -k 

ansible -m setup all - it will colect all fact(information )  for all node 

bydifult when you run any ansible cmd it run fist than do all task 

it make your process liter slow so we ace writhat 

after become: yes 
      gather_facts: yes 

it will make fast your process

ansible -m ping all # this is to ping all clint 

to do task in ansible we have to authontication for that clint it should be user name passwd or ssh_key

when you alredy user the ssh key betwin both clint and server at that time we dosnt need a passwd

but if you wnat to ask password for this use ( -K )  when we use -k it ask passwd but take your curent working terminal username
